make some sort of ECS? agents are raw pointers at the moment, potentially use unique_ptr or something
potentially a boid simulation 
make friendly agents follow player agent check!
make initial state serializable. json? 

terrain, static objects, rendering optimizations

proximity detection with enemies and friendlys

utilities associated with states

how do we do utilities for non discrete states? potentially each state has a set of values? like risk-style combat where sheer numbers wins? this would incentivize them to stay together. i really need to discretize the states though because its impossible to plan in a continuous environment. 


path planning, A*
maximization planning, expectimax? again, don't we need to discretize states

vision, as in like which direction the agent is facing is the information it recieves
have control for agents be determined by the agent itself. proximity, vision, etc...

at the moment, we are leaking memory like crazy lol

use pngs instead of bitmaps
